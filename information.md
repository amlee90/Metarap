#### What are Music NFTs?&#x20;

#### A music NFT, which stands for non-fungible token, is a unique digital asset that lives on the blockchain, and can be bought and sold. Where a regular NFT is typically just a visual asset, a music NFT has a musical component as well as a visual one.&#x20;

#### One of the benefits of owning an asset like an NFT on a blockchain is the transparency of data ownership and accessibility. Because a blockchain is a decentralized system, just about anyone can participate, as long as they have a fast enough internet connection and enough money to fund the purchase in their digital wallet. Cryptocurrency doesnâ€™t have the same policies and regulation that a centralized banking system does, but the transparency of the blockchain is considered self-regulating by design.

#### METARAP music nfts will be traded through Crypto.com and audio will be uploaded through metarap.org. This secures the connection between music and the blockchain. Until future developments arrive, crypto.com will be the only way to acquire an official metarap music nft. Each token id will be linked to metarap.org to secure the bond between crypto.com and metarap. Creating music nfts with real world capabilities. Each nft will be found on cronoscan.
